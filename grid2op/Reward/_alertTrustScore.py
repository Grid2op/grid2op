    .. warning:: /!\\\\ Internal, do not use unless you know what you are doing /!\\\\
            It **must not** serve as a reward. This scored needs to be **MAXIMIZED**,
            as it is a negative! Also, this "reward" is not scaled or anything. Use it as your
            own risk.

    Implemented as a reward to make it easier to use in the context of the L2RPN competitions, this reward is based on the "alert feature" 
    where the agent is asked to send information about potential line overload issue on the grid after unpredictable powerline
    disconnection (attack of the opponent).
    The alerts are assessed once per attack. In this scheme, this "reward" computed the assistant"cost score", which penalized the number of alerts
    the assistant have produced during an episode. It should not be used to train an agent.
