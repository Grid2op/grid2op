class BaseRedispatchSolver(ABC):
    """Base class of the redispatch solvers.

    A solver computes, at each step, the new ``actual_dispatch`` of the generators so that
    the storage units, the curtailment and the detached elements are compensated while
    pmin / pmax and the ramps are respected.

    Only :func:`BaseRedispatchSolver.solve` has to be implemented. Everything else
    (tracking the target dispatch, checking that a redispatching action is valid, the
    minimum up / down times of the generators) is handled by the environment.

    A solver is copied for every environment that uses it (the environment itself, the one
    used by `obs.simulate`, the ones built by the runner, a copy of the environment...), so
    it must be copyable with :func:`copy.deepcopy` and must not share state between
    environments.
