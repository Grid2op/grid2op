Chronics
===================================

Objectives
-----------
This module is present to handle everything related to input data that are not structural.

In the Grid2Op vocabulary a "GridValue" or "Chronics" is something that provides data to change the input parameter
of a power flow between 1 time step and the other.

It is a more generic terminology. Modification that can be performed by :class:`GridValue` object includes, but
are not limited to:

  - injections such as:

    - productions active production setpoint
    - generators voltage setpoint
    - loads active consumption
    - loads reactive consumption

  - structural informations such as:

    - planned outage: powerline disconnection anticipated in advance
    - hazards: powerline disconnection that cannot be anticipated, for example due to a windstorm.

All powergrid modification that can be performed using an :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction` can be implemented as
form of a :class:`GridValue`.

The same mechanism than for :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction` or :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation`
is pursued here. All state modifications made by the :class:`grid2op.Environment` must derived from
the :class:`GridValue`. It is not recommended to create them directly, but rather to use
the :class:`ChronicsHandler` for such a purpose.

Note that the values returned by a :class:`GridValue` are **backend dependant**. A GridValue object should always
return the data in the order expected by the :class:`grid2op.Backend`, regardless of the order in which data are given
in the files or generated by the data generator process.

This implies that changing the backend will change the output of :class:`GridValue`. More information about this
is given in the description of the :func:`GridValue.initialize` method.

Finally, compared to other Reinforcement Learning problems, is the possibility to use "forecast". This optional feature
can be accessed via the :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation` and mainly the
:func:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.simulate` method. The data that are used to generate this forecasts
come from the :class:`grid2op.GridValue` and are detailed in the
:func:`GridValue.forecasts` method.
