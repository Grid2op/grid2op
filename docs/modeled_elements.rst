Elements modeled in this environment and their main properties
===============================================================

Any grid2op environment model different elements. In this section, we explain what is modeled and what is not.

.. note:: Grid2Op do not assume any "power system" modeling. The backend is the only one responsible
    of maintaining the data it generates consistent from a power system point of view.

    The "modeling" here is to be understood as "data you can receive, and what they mean" and also time
    dependencies when it makes sense.

    It do not presume anything about any powersystem modeling.


The elements modeled are (work in progress):

- :ref:`generator`
- :ref:`load`
- :ref:`powerline`
- :ref:`shunt`
- :ref:`storage`
- :ref:`substation`
