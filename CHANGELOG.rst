Change Log
===========

[TODO]
--------------------
- [???] Extensive tests for BridgeReward
- [???] Extensive tests for DistanceReward
- [???] test and doc for opponent
- [???] better logging
- [???] rationalize the public and private part of the API. Some members now are public but should be private.

- [???] better explanation of the notebook 3 with action silently
- [???] have something remembering the topology in the environment, and when an object is
  reconnected, and no buses are specified, then it connects it to last buses.
- [???] see if "simulate" performances can be improved, and performances in general.
- [???] simulate in MultiEnv
- [???] in MultiEnv, when some converter of the observations are used, have each child process to compute
  it in parrallel and transfer the resulting data.
- [???] fix notebook 3 to include code of new agents, and especially to work consistently with runner and env
  (for now if you change default env, it doesn't affect the runner, so it crashes)
- [???] modeled batteries / pumped storage in grid2op (generator but that can be charged / discharged)
- [???] modeled dumps in grid2op (stuff that have a given energy max, and cannot produce more than the available energy)
- [???] fix notebook 5 texts

[0.x.x] - 2020-??-??
--------------------
- [ADDED] class `grid2op.Reward.CombinedScaledReward`: A reward combiner with linear interpolation to stay within a given range.
- [ADDED] `grid2op.Reward.BaseReward.set_range`: All rewards have a default setter for their `reward_min` and `reward_max` attributes. 
  
[0.7.0] - 2020-04-15
--------------------
- [BREAKING] class `grid2op.Environment.BasicEnv` has been renamed `BaseEnv` for consistency. As this class
  should not be used outside of this code base, no backward compatibility has been enforced.
- [BREAKING] class `grid2op.Environment.ObsEnv` has been renamed `_ObsEnv` to insist on its "privateness". As this class
  should not be used outside of this code base, no backward compatibility has been enforced.
- [BREAKING] the "baselines" directory has been moved in another python package that will be released soon.
- [DEPRECATION] `grid2op.Action.TopoAndRedispAction` is now `grid2op.Action.TopologyAndDispatchAction`.
- [FIXED] Performances caveats regarding `grid2op.Backend.PandaPowerBackend.get_topo_vect`: Reduced the method running
  time and reduced number of direct calls to it.
- [FIXED] Command line install scripts: Can now use `grid2op.main` and `grid2op.download` after installing the package
- [FIXED] a bug that prevented to perform redispatching action if the sum of the action was neglectible (*eg* 1e-14)
  instead of an exact `0`.
- [FIXED] Manifest.ini and dockerfile to be complient with standard installation of a python package.
- [ADDED] a notebook to better explain the plotting capabilities of grid2op (work in progrress)
- [ADDED] `grid2op.Backend.reset` as a way for backends to implement a faster way to reload the grid. Implemented in
  `grid2op.Backend.PandaPowerBackend`
- [ADDED] `grid2op.Action.PowerlineChangeAndDispatchAction` A subset of actions to limit the agents scope to
  'switch line' and 'dispatch' operations only
- [ADDED] `grid2op.Action.PowerlineChangeAction` A subset of actions to limit the agents scope to 'switch line'
  operations only

- [ADDED] `grid2op.Action.TopologyChangeAndDispatchAction` A subset of actions to limit the agents scope to 'change'
  and 'redisp' operations only
- [ADDED] `grid2op.Action.DispatchAction` A subset of actions to limit the agents scope to 'redisp' operations only
- [ADDED] a new method to plot other values that the default one for plotplotly.
- [ADDED] a better plotting utilities that is now consistent with `PlotPlotly`, `PlotMatplotlib` and `PlotPyGame`
- [ADDED] a class to replay a logger using `PlotPyGame` class (`grid2op.Plot.EpisodeReplay`)
- [ADDED] a method to parse back the observations with lower memory footprint and faster, when the observations
  are serialized into a numpy array by the runner, and only some attributes are necessary.
- [ADDED] fast implementation of "replay" using PlotPygame and EpisodeData
- [UPDATED] overall documentation: more simple theme, easier organization of each section.


[0.6.1] - 2020-04-??
--------------------
- [FIXED] `Issue #54 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/54>`_: Setting the bus for disconnected lines no
  longer counts as a substation operation.
- [FIXED] if no redispatch actions are taken, then the game can no more invalid a provided action due to error in the
  redispatching. This behavior was caused by increase / decrease of the system losses that was higher (in absolute
  value) than the ramp of the generators connected to the slack bus. This has been fixed by removing the losses
  of the powergrid in the computation of the redispatching algorithm. **side effect** for the generator connected
  to the slack bus, the ramp min / up as well as pmin / pmax might not be respected in the results data provided
  in the observation for example.
- [FIXED] a bug in the computation of cascading failure that lead (sometimes) to diverging powerflow when in the fact
  the powerflow did not diverge.
- [FIXED] a bug in the `OneChangeThenNothing` agent.
- [FIXED] a bug that lead to impossibility to load a powerline after a cascading failure in some cases. Now fixed by
  resetting the appropriate vectors when calling "env.reset".
- [FIXED] function `env.attach_render` that uses old names for the grid layout
- [ADDED] Remember last line buses: Reconnecting a line without providing buses will reconnect it to the buses it
  was previously connected to (origin and extremity).
- [ADDED] Change lines status (aka. switch_line_status) unitary actions for subclasses of AgentWithConverter.
- [ADDED] Dispatching unitary actions for subclasses of AgentWithConverter.
- [ADDED] CombinedReward. A reward combiner to compute a weighted sum of other rewards.
- [ADDED] CloseToOverflowReward. A reward that penalize agents when lines have almost reached max capacity.
- [ADDED] DistanceReward. A reward based on how far way from the original topology the current grid is.
- [ADDED] BridgeReward. A reward based on graph connectivity, see implementation in grid2op.Reward.BridgeReward for details

[0.6.0] - 2020-04-03
---------------------
- [BREAKING] `grid2op.GameRules` module renamed to `grid2op.RulesChecker`

- [DEPRECATION] `HelperAction` is now called `ActionSpace` to better suit open ai gym name. Use of `HelperAction`
  will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] `ObservationHelper` is now called `ObservationSpace` to better suit open ai gym name.
  Use of `ObservationHelper` will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] `Action` class has been split into `BaseAction` that serve as an abstract base class for all
  action class, and `CompleteAction` (that inherit from BaseAction) for the class allowing to perform every
  modification implemented in grid2op.
- [DEPRECATION] `Observation` class has renamed `BaseObservation` that serve as an abstract base class for all
  observation classes. Name Observation will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] `Agent` class has renamed `BaseAgent` that serve as an abstract base class for all
  agent classes. Name Agent will be deprecated in future versions.

  reward classes. Name Reward will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] `LegalAction` class has renamed `BaseRules` that serve as an abstract base class for all
  type of rules classes. Name `LegalAction` will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] typo fixed in `PreventReconection` class (now properly named `PreventReconnection`)
- [ADDED] different kind of "Opponent" can now be implemented if needed (missing deep testing, different type of
  class, and good documentation)
- [ADDED] implement other "rewards" to look at. It is now possible to have an environment that will compute more rewards
  that are given to the agent through the "information" return argument of `env.step`. See the documentation of
  Environment.other_rewards.
- [ADDED] Alternative method to load datasets based on new dataset format: `MakeEnv.make2`
- [ADDED] Layout of the powergrid is part of the `GridObject` and is serialized along with the
  action_space and observation_space. Plotting utilities no longer require specific layout (custom layout
  can still be provided)

  be helpfull for the `VoltageControler` class.
- [FIXED] Loading L2RPN_2019 dataset
- [FIXED] a bug that prevents the voltage controler to be changed when using `grid2op.make`.
- [FIXED] `time_before_cooldown_line` vector were output twice in observation space
  (see `issue 47 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/47>`_ part 1)
- [FIXED] the number of active bus on a substation was not computed properly, which lead to some unexpected
  behavior regarding the powerlines switches (depending on current stats of powerline, changing the buses of some
  powerline has different effect)
  (see `issue 47 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/47>`_ part 2)
- [FIXED] wrong voltages were reported for PandapowerBackend that causes some isolated load to be not detected
  (see `issue 51 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/51>`_ )
- [FIXED] improve the install script to not crash when numba can be installed, but cannot be loaded.
  (see `issue 50 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/50>`_ )

[0.5.0] - 2020-01-23
--------------------
- [BREAKING] BaseAction/Backend has been modified with the implementation of redispatching. If
  you used a custom backend, you'll have to implement the "redispatching" part.
- [BREAKING] with the introduction of redispatching, old action space and observation space,
  stored as json for example, will not be usable: action size and observation size
  have been modified.
