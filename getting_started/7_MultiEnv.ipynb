Though this framework can perfectly be implemented in grid2op, the *SingleEnvMultiProcess* class work a bit differently.\n",

It is really similar to the [SubprocVecEnv](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/ea25b9e8b234e6ee1bca43083f8f3cf974143998/baselines/common/vec_env/subproc_vec_env.py#L39) of open ai gym.\n",
