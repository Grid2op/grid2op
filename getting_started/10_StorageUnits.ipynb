    "## II) What are storage units ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Description\n",
    "Storage units are \"elements\" of a grid that can behave sometimes as generators, sometimes as load (depending on what they are told to do). They can basically store a certain quantity of energy and release it when aked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main types of storage units we can think of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"pumped storage\": they store electric power by pumping it in an upward reservoir and can produce it again by letting the water through a turbine when going downhill (see this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity) for more information)\n",
    "- \"batteries\": they store energy in a chemical form and can be charge / discharge, quit like the battery of a cellphone, but in (way, way) bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In grid2op a storage unit is defined by different parameters. The main ones are:\n",
    "- `storage_Emax`: the maximum energy (expressed in MWh) the storage unit can contain. \n",
    "- `storage_Emin`: the minimum energy (in MWh) allowed in the unit (for example some batteries should not be \"emptied\" entirely)\n",
    "- `storage_loss`: the loss (in MW) in the storage unit. This corresponds to the loss of energy that happens continuously. In reality, this can model the \"self discharge\" of a battery or the evaporation of the upper lake in a pumped storage for example. It should not be mixed with the following two attributes.\n",
    "- `storage_charging_efficiency`: this is the efficiency when the storage units is charged. This efficiency corresponds to the amount of energy that will be stored in the unit if a power of 1MW is taken from the grid to charge it during 1 hour. It has no unit and should be between 0. and 1.\n",
    "- `storage_discharging_efficiency`: this is the efficiency when the storage units is discharged. This efficiency corresponds to the amount of energy that will be substracted from the unit if a power of 1MW is injected in the powergrid during 1 hour. It has no unit and should be between 0. and 1.\n",
    "- `storage_max_p_prod`: the maximum value (still seen from the grid) that a storage unit can inject on the grid. It is expressed in MW.\n",
    "- `storage_max_p_absorb`: the maximum value (still from the grid point of view) that a storage unit can absorb from the grid, expressed also in MW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official documentation](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeled_elements.html#storage-units-optional) gives more details about all these attributes, and some others too. In the cell below we give some example on how to access them:"

    "\n",
    "There are different conventions to model power grid elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the storage unit, we adopted the \"load convention\". In short this means that:\n",
    "- if a positive power setpoint is given, then the storage will behave like a load. It will absorb power from the grid. It will recharge.\n",
    "- if this same power is negative, then the storage will behave like a generator. It will inject power to the grid. It will discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III) Actions on storage units\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every grid2op objects, storage units are manipulated through actions. The only thing you can do with storage units is to give a setpoint of how much power you want it to absorb / produce. This is done with the \"*storage_p*\" keys in the action.\n",
