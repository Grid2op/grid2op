    "The Grid2op package has been built with an \"object-oriented\" perspective: almost everything is encapsulated in a dedicated `class`. This allows for more customization of the plateform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that machine learning methods, especially in deep learning, often prefer to deal with vectors rather than with \"complex\" objects. Indeed, as we covered in the previous tutorials on the platform, we saw that building our own actions can be tedious and can sometime require important knowledge of the powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, in most of the standard Reinforcement Learning environments, actions have a higher representation. For example in pacman, there are 4 different types of actions: turn left, turn right, go up and do down. This allows for easy sampling (if you need to achieve an uniform sampling, you simply need to randomly pick a number between 0 and 3 included) and an easy representation: each action can be represented as a different component of a vector of dimension 4 [because there are 4 actions]. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this representation is not \"human friendly\". It is quite convenient in the case of pacman because the action space is rather small, making it possible to remember which action corresponds to which component, but in the case of the grid2op package, there are hundreds or even thousands of actions, making it impossible to remember which component corresponds to which action. We suppose that we do not really care about this here, as tutorials on Reinforcement Learning with discrete action space often assume that actions are labeled with integers (such as in pacman for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to allow RL agent to train more easily, we allow to make some \"[Converters](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converters.html)\" whose roles are to allow an agent to deal with a custom representation of the action space. The class [AgentWithConverter](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent.html#grid2op.Agent.AgentWithConverter) is perfect for such usage."

    "For many of the Deep Reinforcement Learning problems (for example for model used to play Atari games), the inputs are images and the outputs are integers that encode the different possible actions (typically \"move up\" or \"move down\" in Atari). In our system (the powergrid) it is rather different. We did our best to make the convertion between complex and simple structures easy. Indeed, the use of converters such as ([IdToAct](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converter.html#grid2op.Converter.IdToAct)) allows easily to:\n",
    "- convert the class \"Observation\" into vectors automatically\n",
    "- map the actions from integers to complete `Action` objects defined in the previous notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a converter allows to manipulate the \"action space\" of the Agent and is such that:\n",
    "- the Agent manipulates a simple, custom structure of actions\n",
    "- the Converter takes care of mapping from this simple structure to complex grid2op Action / Observation objects\n",
    "- as a whole, the Agent will actually return full Action / Observation objects to the environment while only working with more simple objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on the converter\n",
    "To use this converter, the Agent must inherit from the class [`grid2op.Agent.AgentWithConverter`](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent.html#grid2op.Agent.AgentWithConverter) and implement the following interface (shown here as an example):\n",

This transformed action will then be converted back to the original action space to an actual `Action` object in the **act** method, that you must leave unchanged.\n",
    "- some automatic functions can compute the set of all possible actions, so there is no need to write \"self.my_actions = ...\". This was done as an example only.\n",
    "- if the converter is properly set up, you don't even need to modify \"convert_obs(self, observation)\" and \"convert_act(self, encoded_act)\" as default convertions are already provided in the implementation. However, if you want to work with a custom observation space and action space, you can modify these two methods in order to have the convertions that you need."
