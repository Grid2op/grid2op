    "With the module \"grid2op.PlotGrid\" (more information on the official documentation [here](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotgrid.html)) it is possible to gather visual insights (plots) about the state of the powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module currently involves 2 \"base\" classes:\n",
    "- `PlotMatplot` which uses the well-known matplotlib python library to render the plot. Matplotlib being the most used plotting library in python, we decided to add its support in grid2op.\n",
    "- `PlotPlotly` that uses the plotply library. Plotly is particularly suited for studying more deeply what happens at some particular time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not recommended to use any of these. Rather, we developped two higher-level classes:\n",
    "- `EpisodeReplay` which uses the \"PlotMatplotlib\" class internally and is used to render a video as a gif or a mp4 file. This is mainly designed to communicate the results of your agent.\n",
    "- `env.render` which is similar to the gym method `env.render` that all people used to the open ai gym framework will be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, a package called `grid2viz` has been developped to help you diagnose in-depth the behaviour of your agent. This package is much more advanced than all the other methods presented above and we highly recommend you to use this package to get the best out of your agents!"
